# Deployment onto AWS

This document provides a comprehensive guide for deploying the ProductService application on AWS infrastructure. We'll cover all the necessary components and their configurations in a logical sequence.

## Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

A VPC is your isolated network in the AWS cloud where you'll deploy all your resources.

### Key Components:
- **Subnets**: Subdivisions of your VPC's IP address range
  - Public subnets: For resources that need internet access (load balancers, bastion hosts)
  - Private subnets: For your application and database instances
- **Internet Gateway**: Allows communication between your VPC and the internet
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables private subnet resources to access the internet while remaining private
- **Route Tables**: Define the network traffic rules for your subnets

### Best Practices:
- Use multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability
- Implement proper network segmentation using public and private subnets
- Follow the principle of least privilege for network access

## Security Groups (SG)

Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your AWS resources at the instance level.

### Key Concepts:
- Stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed
- Can specify allow rules only (deny by default)
- Can reference other security groups

### Common Configurations:
1. **Application SG**:
   - Inbound: HTTP/HTTPS from load balancer
   - Outbound: Access to RDS
2. **Database SG**:
   - Inbound: Database port access from application SG
   - Outbound: All traffic
3. **Load Balancer SG**:
   - Inbound: HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere
   - Outbound: Access to application instances

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 provides the virtual servers where your application will run.

### Key Considerations:
- **Instance Types**: Choose based on CPU, memory, and network requirements
- **AMI Selection**: Use Amazon Linux 2 for optimal AWS integration
- **Storage**: EBS volumes for persistent storage
- **Auto Scaling**: Configure for automatic scaling based on demand
- **Monitoring**: Enable CloudWatch for metrics and alerts

### Best Practices:
- Use appropriate instance size based on application needs
- Implement proper backup strategies for EBS volumes
- Use instance metadata for configuration
- Enable detailed monitoring when needed

## RDS (Relational Database Service)

RDS provides managed relational databases, replacing the local MySQL database used in development.

### Configuration:
- **Engine**: MySQL (compatible with the application)
- **Instance Class**: Choose based on workload requirements
- **Multi-AZ**: Enable for high availability
- **Storage**: Use GP2 or IO1 based on performance needs
- **Backup**: Configure automated backups and retention period

### Best Practices:
- Place RDS instances in private subnets
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use parameter groups for database optimization
- Implement proper backup and restore procedures
- Monitor performance metrics with CloudWatch
- Set up appropriate maintenance windows

## Elastic Beanstalk (EB)

Elastic Beanstalk simplifies application deployment and management, bringing multiple instances of the service together.

### Key Features:
- Automates deployment, scaling, and provisioning of resources
- Supports multiple environments (development, staging, production)
- Built-in integration with AWS services (RDS, S3, CloudWatch)
- Supports multiple programming platforms including Java
- Allows custom configurations while hiding operational complexity

### Deployment Strategies:
1. **All at Once**:
   - Updates all instances simultaneously
   - Fastest but involves downtime
   - Best for development environments

2. **Rolling**:
   - Updates instances in batches
   - Minimal to no downtime
   - Suitable for production with proper capacity planning

3. **Rolling with Additional Batch**:
   - Launches new instances before taking old ones out of service
   - Zero downtime but requires additional capacity
   - Recommended for production environments

### Service Roles and IAM:
- **Service Role**: Permissions for EB to manage AWS resources
- **Instance Profile**: Permissions for application instances to access AWS services

## DNS Configuration

DNS (Domain Name System) maps your domain names to AWS resources.

### Components:
1. **Route 53**:
   - AWS's managed DNS service
   - Supports multiple routing policies
   - Enables health checks and failover

2. **Record Types**:
   - A Record: Points domain to IPv4 address
   - CNAME: Points domain to another domain name
   - Alias: AWS-specific record for AWS resources

### Best Practices:
- Use aliases for AWS resources when possible
- Implement health checks
- Configure TTL appropriately

## Deployment Process

1. **Preparation**:
   - Package application as JAR
   - Prepare environment variables
   - Configure database migration scripts

2. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Create VPC and networking components
   - Set up security groups
   - Create RDS instance
   - Configure Elastic Beanstalk environment

3. **Application Deployment**:
   - Upload application to Elastic Beanstalk
   - Configure environment properties
   - Verify health checks
   - Test the deployment

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Set up CloudWatch alerts
   - Configure logging
   - Plan for updates and patches
   - Implement backup strategies

## Cost Optimization

### Best Practices:
- Use appropriate instance sizes
- Implement auto-scaling based on demand
- Reserve instances for predictable workloads
- Monitor and optimize resource utilization
- Use spot instances where applicable
- Regular review of unused resources
